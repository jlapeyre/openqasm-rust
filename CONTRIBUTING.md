### Building

The Rust parser is copied into `./src`.
Building the parser requires antlr. I will organize this somewhere.

### Notes

* Line number 5705 in `qasm3parser.rs`, as generated by the target code is,
```rust
impl<'input> qasm3ParserParserContext<'input> for ExpressionContextAll<'input>{}
```
But `ParserParser` is erroneous. This file has been edited by hand to replace
`ParserParser` with `Parser`. This should be fixed somehow in generation
